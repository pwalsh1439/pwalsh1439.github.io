				Hello my name is Paul Walsh and Welcome to my online portfolio.
			</p>
			<p>
				This portfolio has been created as a location to collate and showcase my work while studying on the "Programming for Spatial Analysts: Core Skills"
				module. This module is the first of my second year of studying on the MSc in "GIS" distance learning course.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have been completing my studies at the same time as a working full time as GIS Consultant for Helyx SIS Ltd. I have been with Helyx for three years,
				previously  I did eight years in the British Army working as a Geospatial Analyst.
